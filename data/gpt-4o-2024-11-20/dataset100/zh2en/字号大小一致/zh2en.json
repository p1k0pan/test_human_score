These conditions are normal and do not affect the fruit's quality. On the contrary, dragon fruits grown under such conditions are more fragrant and flavorful.  \n\nThin skin  \n\nWater crack marks, scars  \n\nStem withering, slightly blackened leaf scales  \n\nAfter harvesting, dragon fruits turn soft and watery, like an aloe leaf or the palm of a hand. If not refrigerated, they may ferment. You can directly peel or cut the fruit to eat—these are normal phenomena that don't affect the flesh.  \nDo not overthink!  ",
